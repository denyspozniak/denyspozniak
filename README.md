# Hi there, I'm Denys Pozniak

## VoIPOps Architect | DevOps + VoIP Expert

I've been immersed in the IT industry since 2005, beginning my journey with FreeBSD administration. From there, I transitioned into working extensively with Cisco networking equipment, which paved the way for my eventual move into VoIP. My diverse experience has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of solution architecture.

Today, I identify myself as a **VoIPOps Architect** — a unique blend of DevOps and VoIP, symbolizing my expertise in both domains.
